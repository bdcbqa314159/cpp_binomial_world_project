# Binomial World Project in C++

Implementing the Binomial Model to pricing different derivatives.
This project is the result of my willing to code in c++ the results and the examples shown in some modules present in a specialization course I followed in coursera (cite it here).
When you take some random literature, the binomial model is mainly covered on stocks and some options and that is it. So when I saw the course I found really interesting the whole range of things done with this "simple" model.
After that I went deeper into the lectures and there are loads of interesting and serious books or papers about this subject.
At the moment I used a foundation of some ideas present in a c++ book: (cite it here) and some others projects I made by the past.
It would be nice if a lot of products are covered and also some sensitivities calculations. My current lecture is about the HJM in a binomial model world so one possible implementation of this lecture will land here soon.
The topics covered:

- Pricing contracts on stocks with the assumption of risk free rate flat.
- Pricing some fixing income derivatives using the term structure of the risk free rate.
- Calibration of the term structure of the risk free rate with the Black-Derman-Toy model.

All in all you will find:

- Forwards
- Futures
- Options (Euro - American) on Futures
- Zero coupon Bonds
- Coupon Bearing Bonds, forwards and futures on them
- Caplets and Floorets (Euro and in-arrears)
- Swaps and Swaptions

This is just to have fun with numerical methods, c++ and financial modeling.
